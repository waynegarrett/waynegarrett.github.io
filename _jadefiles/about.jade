        | My name is Wayne Garrett. I was born and raised in Lynchburg, Virginia, and as far as an actual job goes, I currently work as the Digital Asset and Web Assistant for the College Communication and Marketing Department at Lynchburg College. On the side, however, I occasionally design websites.
